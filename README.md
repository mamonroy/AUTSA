# Automated Unit Testing Suites & Analysis (AUTSA)

| Date | Iteration Title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 – March 1 to March 7 | Parser implementation  | Create Python scripts that recognizes source code and also be able to distinguish routines and classes within the code |
| Week 2 – March 7 to March 14 | Design identification algorithm | Write code to identify variables and instances in Python source code |
| Week 3 – March 14 to March 21 | Design evaluation algorithm| Implement the algorithm where it automatically generates unit testing based on the Design identification algorithm. This includes exporting the unit tests into another files |
| Week 4 – March 21 to March 28 | Implement visualization module | Implement visual charts to display the classes and subroutines that are existing |
| Week 5 – March 28 to April 4| 1st Mutation testing | Test out how many test cases are generated, validate those test cases that are applicable for the code and time taken for generation |
| Week 6 – April 4 to April 11 | Software tweaks | Based on the 1st Mutation Testing, tweaks could be made on the tool to further enhance the accuracy and efficiency |
| Week 7 – April 11 to April 14 | 2nd Mutation testing | Check if the number of test cases increases or generation time is shorten |
| Week 8 – April 14 to April 16 | Writing up the report | Include data and graphs to support results found and justify whether the tool successfully does what it is supposed to do using the metrics of success |
